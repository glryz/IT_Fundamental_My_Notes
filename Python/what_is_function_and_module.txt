•	A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. 
As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions.

•	A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. 
Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. 
A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
